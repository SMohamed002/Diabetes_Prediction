# Diabetes_Prediction
This project consists of a number of people with and without diabetes. The data is analyzed, displayed, and cleaned to be processed and used in machine learning models to predict whether the disease is present in new people or not. This is done by training on a dataset of people, some of whom are sick and some of whom are not.
